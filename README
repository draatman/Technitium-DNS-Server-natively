The web UI is always at http://<server-ip>:5380/

These scripts are reusable — you can run update-tds.sh whenever a new release comes out

How these scripts work

Technitium publishes a generic install script at:

https://download.technitium.com/dns/install.sh


Running that script via curl | sudo bash automatically detects the latest official version, pulls its binaries, and installs them for your platform. That’s exactly what these helper scripts wrap.

Pro tips

You can run the update script periodically via cron to automatically keep your DNS server up to date.

Your existing configuration and cache stay intact; only the binaries get replaced.

The web UI always stays at http://<server-ip>:5380/.
